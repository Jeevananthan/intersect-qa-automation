#    Given HS I am logged in to Intersect HS through Naviance with user type "navianceAdmin"
#    Then HS I create a College Fair with the following data

  Scenario: As a high school RepVisits user, I want to be able to specify who is notified of changes to college fairs,
            So that I can be sure the right staff members are informed.
    #BLUE4HS has an issue with duplicated Primary contacts, so using standalone 1 instead.
    Given HS I am logged in to Intersect HS through Naviance with user type "navianceAdmin"
    Then HS I verify configuration and staff notifications for "District Manager" and "NidhuHS User"
    Then HS I set the data to create the College Fair "QA Test Fair New/Edit","3","0900AM","1000AM","2","$25","25","100","Save"
    Then HS I add the following attendees to the College Fair
      |Andrew Lane|
    Then HS I verify that the user receives an activity notification with "PreviouslySetFair" and "Andrew Lane"
    Then HS I verify non community members to be notified with "frank.sejas@gmail.com" and "incorrectemail.com" email
