Feature: HS - RepVisits - CollegeFairs - As an HS user, I want to be able to use the RepVisits College Fair features

  @MATCH-1617 @MATCH-1997
  Scenario: As a high school community user, I want to be able to accept or deny a college that requests to attend my fair.
            So that I can ensure the colleges attending are a good match for my students.Â 
    Given HS I am logged in to Intersect HS through Naviance with account "blue4hs" and username "iam.purple" and password "password"
    Then HS I create a College Fair with the following data
      | College Fair Name                                         | Fair QA Test#03         |

      | Max Number of Colleges                                    | 10                      |
      | Number of Students Expected                               | 10                      |

    And HS I successfully sign out

    # Log back into the HS app to accept and decline the attendance requests from above
    Given HS I am logged in to Intersect HS through Naviance with account "blue4hs" and username "iam.purple" and password "password"
    Then HS I make sure the "Confirm" button works properly for college fair attendee requests for "Fair QA Test#03"
