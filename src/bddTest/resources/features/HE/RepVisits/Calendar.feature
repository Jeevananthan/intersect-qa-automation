@HE
Feature: HE - RepVisits - Calendar - As an HE user I want to use the RepVisits Calendar features.

  @MATCH-4222
  Scenario: As an RepVisits HE admin premium/paid Presence subscription user, I want the ability to see and select which
  visits and college fair registrations I'd like to transfer at the "Re-assign appointments" modal for the selected HE rep,
  so that I can support appropriate appointment transfer as necessary at a single appointment level or in bulk from one
  user to another user.
    Given HE I want to login to the HE app using "purpleheautomation+administrator@gmail.com" as username and "Password!1" as password
    When HS I go to re assign appointments
    Then HS I verify UI components with the option "Publishing, PurpleHE" in the drop down action
    Then HS I verify UI components with the option "Community, PurpleHE" in the drop down action
    And HE I successfully sign out

  Scenario Outline: As Hobsons product manager managing value adds to getting HE users to upgrade to RV Presence premium subscription,
  I want the RV>Calendar, Agenda view to be premium level access on the HE side while remaining accessible for HS users,
  So that further value can be provided to upgrade to an RV Presence premium subscription.

    Given HE I am logged in to Intersect HE as user type "<hePremium>"
    Then HE I verify the user can access "Agenda" view
    And HE I successfully sign out

    Given HE I am logged in to Intersect HE as user type "<heFreemium>"
    Then HE I verify the message "Unlock Agenda View" is displaying in the "Agenda" page
    Then HE I verify "UPGRADE" button is displaying in the "Agenda" page
    Then HE I verify the upgrade model page after clicking the UPGRADE button in Agenda view
    And HE I successfully sign out

      |hePremium    |heFreemium       |
