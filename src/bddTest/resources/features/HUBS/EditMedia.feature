  Scenario: As an HE user with the Publishing or Administrator role I want to be able to publish my Premium HEM (React)
            updates so my Naviance College Profile can stay up-to-date.
    When HUBS I click on "MEDIA" tab
    And HUBS I click on "Publish my media changes" button
    Then HUBS I verify the Publishing Modal Confirmation with the "Youâ€™re almost done!" element
    Then HUBS I verify the Publishing Modal Confirmation with the "The approval process can take up to 24-48 hours." element
    Then HUBS I verify the Publishing Modal Confirmation with the "Please provide a brief explanation for the changes:" element
    Then HUBS I verify the Publishing Modal Confirmation with the "Cancel and continue editing" element
    Then HUBS I verify the Publishing Modal Confirmation with the "Submit changes" element
    Then HUBS I verify the Publishing Modal Confirmation with the "IE: We've moved the admissions office!" element
    Then HUBS I verify functionality of Publishing Modal Confirmation
